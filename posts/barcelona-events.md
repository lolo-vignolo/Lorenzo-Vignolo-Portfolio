## How this App was done? 👨‍💻

In order to get better positioning and to give useful information to the **Crawler**, I have decided to create this webSite using **Next.js**. With the help of two really strong instruments such us **GetStaticProps** and **GetStaticPath**, I could achieve a **service side rendering** in the building moment. In this way, I offer key information to these crawlers. Also, in this Website Login and Auth screens were done using Next/Auth, in this way any user has to be login in order to visit the different private routes. Also, taking into account that in this App the administrator has to update the information, I decided to create a private route abailable for people that manage the webApp. The BackEnd was done using Mongoo DB, the deplyment by Vercel taking the advantage that it offers for next.js apps.

In this App you can see the next tools that have been used 🧨:

- Next.js
- Next/Auth
- seccions
- JWT
- Hooks
- Chakra UI
- Pages
- \_Api
- CSS modules
- HTML
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- GoogleMaps
- and More
- vercel
