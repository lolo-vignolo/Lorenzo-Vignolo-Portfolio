## What about this project? 🌍

As you could see, it is a complete App thought to show Argentina, where people can add new places if they wish. I create this app taking into consideration that in my trips, many people asked me about my country. Now, I have something to show, right? ⛺

## How this App was done? 👨‍💻

In order to get better positioning and to give useful information to the **Crawler**, I have decided to create this webSite using **Next.js**. With the help of two really strong instruments such us **GetStaticProps** and **GetStaticPath**, I could achieve a **service side rendering** in the building moment. In this way, I offer key information to these crawlers. 

In this App you can see the next tools that have been used 🧨:

- Next.js
- Hooks
- Chakra UI
- Pages 
- _Api
- CSS
- HTML
- Node.js
- MongoDB
-GoogleMaps
- and More
