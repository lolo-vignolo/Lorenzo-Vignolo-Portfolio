## What is this project about? 🧨

This app was a technic test for an Angular position, the goal of this project was to create an app similar to Nexflix where users could select between films and movies, create a searcher, and an option to save the last view visited, and give special information about a specific choice. The **data** was gotten through an API given by the company.

## How this App was done? 👨‍💻

For this App I had some rules to follow:
_Dreadful Tomato needs to implement an awesome webpage where the users could view information about almost every new TV Shows and movie._

The Design team has sent us the new interface which has to be implemented. As you could see, **there are three different pages.**

- The first page is a landing page where the user could select whether she wants to see TV shows or movies and some claims and logo of Dreadful Tomato
- The second one is the list of TV shows. Here, the user could filter TV shows by title and release year. On that page, the user will see a list of cards with the title, description, and image from each TV show.
- The third one is quite similar, but for the movies. The user could filter by title and release year as well, to see a list of cards with the information of every movie.
