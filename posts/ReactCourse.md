## Some famous Hooks 🤗

```js
export default Component = () => {

    const [progress , setProgress] = useState("study")

    <button onClick = {()=>setProgress("Almost Done")}> Submit <button>

    const useEffectIs = () =>{
        console.log("useEffect is one of the most intresting
        and useful Hooks in React")
    }

    UseEffect (()=>{
