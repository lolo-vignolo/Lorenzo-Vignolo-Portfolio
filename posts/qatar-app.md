## What about this App? 🥇

This App was built with the aim of offering a kind of space where people can give their opinions about the **Qatar Football word cup**. As well, users will have the opportunity to upload pictures with statistics, teams, players, and more. 🙌

## How this App was done? 👨‍💻

App built using Next.js and its most wonrderful tool, which allows us a **server-side rendering** such as **getInitialPorps()**. Then, I have done programmatic navigation using **useRouter** in order to achieve a piece of the URL to navigate to a specific page. The **backend** was done using **Firebase**.
