## What about this project? 🧐

My intention in this project was to create a Calendar showing my skills working with **functional components, states, hooks, Redux**, and so on.

## How this App was done? 👨‍💻

Because a calendar has to manage a huge amount of events I have decided to build this app using **React.js** and the help of **Redux** to manage such events, meanwhile the Back was entirely done in MongoDB.

In this App you can see the next tools that have been used 🧨:

- Functional component
- Hooks
- Tokens - JWT
- Modal
- Routes (Public and Private)
- CSS
- HTML
- Dispatch
- and More
